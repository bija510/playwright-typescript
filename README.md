# Playwright-Typescript

## üëã Introduction
Playwright is an open-source Node.js library developed by Microsoft for automated end-to-end testing of web applications. It supports modern browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit and allows you to write reliable, fast, and cross-browser tests. When combined with TypeScript, it provides a powerful, type-safe development experience, making it easier to build and maintain complex test suites.

In this project, we are using **Playwright with TypeScript** to take advantage of strong typing, better developer tooling, and improved code maintainability.

```ts
await page.locator('form#login >> text="Submit"');
```
## üìò Playwright-Typescript Naming Conventions Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to standard naming conventions in project to help maintain clean and consistent code.

### üî† Naming Conventions Table

| **Element**        | **Convention**      | **Example**                  |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| File Name          | `kebab-case`        | `user-profile.ts`            |
| Test File          | `kebab-case + .test`  | `login.test.ts`           |
| Folder Name        | `kebab-case`        | `demo-test`                  |
| Component File     | `PascalCase`        | `UserProfile.ts`             |
| Function Name      | `camelCase`         | `getUserInfo()`              |
| Variable Name      | `camelCase`         | `userEmail`                  |

| Constant Name      | `UPPER_CASE`        | `MAX_RETRIES`                |
| Boolean Name       | `camelCase`         | `isLoggedIn`, `hasAccess`    |

### ‚úÖ Summary

- Use **kebab-case** for regular `.ts` file names.
- Use **kebab-case + .test** for playwright E2E test files `(*.spec.ts, *.test.ts)`.
- Use **PascalCase** for files that export components or classes.
- Use **camelCase** for variables, functions, and booleans.
- Use **UPPER_CASE** for constants that should not change.

## Pre-requirements:
 1. `scoop`
 2. `Node JS`
 3. A code editor (e.g., `Visual Studio Code`)
 4. `devDependencies` inside `package.json` file
 5. To install dependencies
 It will only available in this package not global & all file will store in  `node modules`

# üì• Installation Guide

### Step 1: ü•Ñ Install Scoop 

To install Scoop, open PowerShell in Windows and run:

```sh
irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

After installation, close and reopen PowerShell, then run:

```sh
scoop help
```

### Step 2: Install Node.js

To install Node.js, run:

```sh
scoop install nodejs
```

To confirm Node.js and npm were installed correctly, check their versions:

- `npm`: used to install, update, and manage JavaScript libraries or tools.
- `npx`: lets you run Node.js packages without installing them globally.

```powershell
node -v
npm -v
npx -v
```

To update Node.js:

```sh
scoop update nodejs
```
### Step 3: Installing Playwright
1. Run the command below to `install` & select the following to get started:
2. Choose between `TypeScript` or JavaScript (default is TypeScript)
3. Name of your Tests folder (default is tests or `e2e` if you already have a tests folder in your project)
4. Add a `GitHub Actions workflow` to easily run tests on CI
5. Install `Playwright browsers` (default is true)

```sh
npm init playwright@latest
```

It will install & create following files basically a `project` with example tests.
1. playwright.config.ts
2. package.json
3. package-lock.json
4. tests/
  example.spec.ts
5. tests-examples/
  demo-todo-app.spec.ts

### Other useful devDependencies
After adding the `devDependencies` in your `package.json`, run this command in Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt: `Example`
```json
  "devDependencies": {       
       "dotenv": "^16.4.5"
    }
```

```sh
npm install
```
or npm install dotenv

`@playwright/test` 
The dependency "@playwright/test": "^1.52.0" provides Playwright Test, which is Playwright's built-in test runner and testing framework. It simplifies writing, running, and organizing end-to-end (E2E) tests for web applications.

`@types/node` 
The @types/node package provides TypeScript type definitions for Node.js built-in modules like fs, path, and globals like process and __dirname. It's used in Playwright projects with TypeScript to enable type checking and IntelliSense for Node.js APIs.

### Updating Playwright
```sh
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
```

### Checking Playwright version
```sh
npx playwright --version
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run single or multiple test from VS Code with just click.
1. Install the **Playwright Test for VSCode** plugin from Microsoft.
2. Open the `playwright.config.ts` file and update the `testDir` path:
```typescript
   export default defineConfig({
     testDir: './e2e',
```
3. Now, each test inside the `test.describe` block will display a triangle ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon to run the test.
4. Look for the glass jar icon with a half-filled sign `(Test Explorer)` below the Extensions section in the Activity Bar.
5. You can also run tests from there as well.

 ## cmd command to open website to record script.
 ```sh
 npx playwright codegen wikipedia.org 
 ```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è How to Upload File

1. **Using an `<input>` HTML Tag**
   - If the HTML tag `<input>` is present with the attribute `type="file"`, we can use the method:
     ```js
     page.setInputFiles()
     ```

2. **Without an `<input>` Tag**
   - If the HTML tag is not available or the file upload is triggered by a button or other UI element (e.g., causing a native file chooser to appear), then:
     - In Selenium, we typically use third-party tools like **Robot Class**, **Sikuli**, or **AutoIt** to handle the file upload dialog.
     - In Playwright, we use:
       ```js
       fileChooser.setFiles(filePath1)
       ```
       along with a **listener** to handle the file chooser event.
     - This approach allows us to programmatically handle native file picker popups.

 ## { } How to read JSON data file.
 1. Create testData.json file
 2. Create playwright.config.ts file & paste this
 ```js
  declare module "*.json" {
    const value: any;
    export default value
  }
 ```
 3. Then in the LoginTest.test.ts file import this.
  ```
  import * as testData from "../../data/TestData.json"
  ```
  4. Then declare this const variable & use Example:-  data.firstName, data.lastName..
  ```
  let data = <any>testData
  ```
